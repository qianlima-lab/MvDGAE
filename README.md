# MvDGAE
The paper "Multi-view Denoising Graph Auto-Encoders on Heterogeneous Information Networks for Cold-start Recommendation" accepted by 2021 SIGKDD.

# Dataset
We evaluate our proposed method on three public benchmark datasets, i.e., DBook, MovieLens and Yelp, which are provided by <https://github.com/rootlu/MetaHIN>, including the training/testing data split.

# Code
We implement the proposed MvDGAE based on the large-scale graph learning framework PlatoDeep.
Our code has been released within Tencent and will be pubished as the PlatoDeep released.
